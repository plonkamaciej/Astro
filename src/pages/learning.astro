                    Astro.js is a web development framework gaining popularity for its focus on performance and developer experience. Lately, a new integration called Astro DB has recently been added. This integration allows you to leverage a powerful, local, type-safe SQL database specifically designed for the Astro ecosystem. This means you can develop locally with Astro and seamlessly deploy your database through your Astro Studio dashboard. Astro DB offers type-safe SQL queries, giving you the benefit of catching errors during development and ensuring data integrity.

                <p>
                    Python is a versatile programming language widely used in machine learning (ML) and data science. With its extensive libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, Python enables developers to build and deploy ML models efficiently. From preprocessing data to training neural networks, Python offers tools and frameworks to support the entire machine learning workflow, making it a popular choice among researchers and practitioners in AI and ML.
